LIVING LIGHT- A lighting can change its brightness base on the enviornment light

Summary
LIVING LIGHT is a ambient lighting. It can change automaticly when the enviornment turns dark and can change the color of 
light by the switch. 

Timeline
Week 1
Defining the components I will needs for buiding the arduino circuit. Designing the appearance of the lighting and start to
plan how to build the circuit. 
Week 2
Building the arduino circuit and define the code need to be used for the output.
Week 3 
Adjustify the code, make sure it can work smoothly. Putting the arduino circuit in the lighting structure.

Components part
Plywood for cutting out the apperance for the lighting.
Arduino circuit.(Arduino UNO R3, I/O Sensor Expansion Shield, Digital Piranha LED-R, TowerPro SG50 Servo, 
Analog Ambient Light Sensor)

Challenge
Need to know each part how to work.
Building the circuit. Making sure everything is the right place.
How the switch will work.
Defining the code for the lighting.(How to response to the enviornment light?)
