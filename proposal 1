YOUR ROBOT BUDDY - DUDU(Gesture Controlled Bot)

Summary
DUDU is a hand gesture control pull toy and it will looks like a dinosaur. Users will wear a controller bracelets. The bracelet 
has sensors link to the pull toy and lead the direction (left, right, backward, forward).

Timeline
Week 1
Defining the what compponents I need to prepare for buiding the robot. Designing and using lasercut to cut out the apperance
of the gesture conctrolled box.
Week 2
Putting every components together and start to upload the code to Arduino and test the robot. Applying the hand gesture on 
moving direction.
Week 3 
Adjustify the code make sure the robot movement route can pair up with the hand gesture.

Components part
Plywood for cutting out the apperance for the robot.
Arduino circuit.(Adafruit BNO055 Absolute Orientation Sensor, Arduino MKR1000, Arduino Uno, Arduino Motor Shield, batteries)

Challenge
Arduino is new area to me, so it might need sometimes for me to learn about the circuit building. Also the coding is another 
challenge part for me since I am not sure what kinds arguments or functions I will need for output.
Need to know how's each components fuctioning. (Where should I place the components on the robot?)
Need to get more familiar with the output code. (How to adjust speed? How to apply the hand gesture in the code?)
